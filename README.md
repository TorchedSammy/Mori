# Mori
> ðŸŒ² Automatically put osu! related archives in their places.

Mori is a simple file/directory watching daemon, which moves recently downloaded
osu! archives (osz/osk, beatmaps/skins) into their relevant directories.
For people that are lazy and don't want to drag and drop ([or can't](#Rationale)).

## Rationale
I have recently got into playing osu! again, while on Linux. 
With a handy script, I got it setup easily and performs better than osu!lazer on my bad
laptop. Except drag and drop did not work so I could not import skins/beatmaps
in that way. This is why Mori was born. It automatically puts recently created/
downloaded osu! beatmaps into osu!'s song directory, and skins in the skins
directory. Then to import, just press F5 in beatmaps list. Or when you go back to it,
it'll import.

# Install
If you want, you can manually compile Mori with the steps below.
Getting Mori is pretty easy. All you need is [Go](https://go.dev) downloaded
(and git, yknow).

Type these commands in a terminal:  
```
git clone https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Mori
cd Mori
go get -d
go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o mori
sudo cp mori /usr/local/bin/ # install globally (chose a different path if you want)
```  

# Usage
> Mori won't move beatmaps that are moved in normally to the source direcory
immediately, read on how [it watches for changes](#Detection).

Simply run `mori &`, which will spawn Mori as a background job in your shell.  
It'll log any files that were moved. You can also make Mori startup on boot as a
user service.

## Configuration
Mori uses a JSON config, located in `~/.config/mori/mori.json`.
If you want, you can change this to another location with the `-C` flag.
It does not create this default config, but as a reference it looks like:  
```json
{
	"osuDir": "~/.local/share/osu-wine/OSU",
	"sourceDir": "~/Downloads",
	"sweepTime": "5m",
	"autoExtract": true
}
```
`sourceDir` is where Mori will watch, and copy from.  
`osuDir` is the osu! data directory, where all the files are.  
`sweepTime` is the interval of when Mori will sweep the source directory for archives.  
`autoExtract` defines whether Mori will automatically extract skins.

## Detection
Mori detects "new" osu! archives by watching the configured directory to see if
any files have been chmod'd, which is usually what happens when a while is created
(and also when you, well, chmod a file). This means that beatmaps/skins that were
already in the configured directory or moved in won't automatically be moved to
their direcory. Fear not, as Mori checks every 5 minutes if there are files in
the current directory that have the `osz` or `osk` extension! If they do, it'll
move them.
